Working of JS : 

# Added event listener to the textarea
on keypressup, the value of the textarea is stored in a variable.

# The createinput function takes the value,sepeartes the string into substrings by seperating on basis of commas
and trimming spaces and filtering out empty substrings. 
Then for each substring, a new span element is created within the "choices" div and assigned a class "choice" that has predefined css 
These span elements are appended to the choices div.

# When we press ENTER , the textarea is cleared out and randomSelect function is called which calls the randomChoice function.

# In randomChoice function, all the elements with the class of "choice" are selected and put in an array. 
The length of the array is used with math.random function to create a random number that will represent the index of the array.

# This random element is then returned to the randomSelect function, 
where it is passed as argument to the addHighlight and removeHighlight functions.

# The highlighting process continues for specified amount of time (30(times)*100ms) before stopping on a random element
and permanently highlighting it.
